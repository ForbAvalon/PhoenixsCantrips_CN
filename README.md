# PhoenixsCantrips

Scaling Cantrips are a great idea. Too bad the mod that does it is ancient and jank and fills up your characters with junk data.

## Mod features

Jolt, Ray Of Frost, Acid Splash, Disrupt Undead and Divine Zap all get an extra die per 2 CL to a maximum of six dice.

Virtue adds an extra temp hp per two CL, max ten.

Descriptions!

Oracles with elemental mysteries that don't get their mystery spell lists replaced get the associated ranged attack cantrip.

Winter Patron Witchs and Winter Witchs (the Prestige Class) get Ray of Frost

Not currently working for archetypes that replace the mystery features with custom ones, will work if the mystery selector is replaced to limit selection ranges.
Not currently working for Flames mystery, need to make fire ranged cantrip.
